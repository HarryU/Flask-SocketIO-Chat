DM Online
===================

A simple web application to assist a DM or other RPG leader in sharing thematic content with a group that can't be physically co-located for a given session.

To run this application install the requirements in a virtual environment, run `python dm.py` and visit `http://localhost:5000` on one or more browser tabs.

If you prefer, you can also start the server using the Flask cli:

    $ FLASK_APP=dm.py flask run
